After 20 years of playing professional football, i’d like to thank every manager I’ve had the pleasure of working with. To every player i’ve played with, you’ve been my second family! I’ve had so many great memories that I’ll never forget and i’ve been so lucky to win trophies along the way.
Playing for my country has also been a huge privilege and source of pride for me. I’ve always dreamed of walking off the pitch for the last time with my family and i’m thankful I’ve had that moment with them.
